#Introduction
This is the Readme file for the third group assignment for the course <a href="https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures" target="_blank">MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis</a> taught by <a href="https://github.com/christophergandrud
" target="_blank">@ChristopherGandrud</a>.
According to the <a href="https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures">Syllabus</a>, the purpose of the third assignment is gathering, cleaning and analysing data for our collaborative reasearch project investigating **how the rise in  the rise in inequality and economic growth influences the purchase of luxury goods, particularly cars, and the usage of public transportation systems in Singapore, from 1960 to 2015.**
The requirements of the assignment are the following: 
- Gathering web-based data from at least two sources. Cleaning and merging the data so that it is ready for statistical analyses.
- Conducting basic descriptive and inferential statistics with the data to address a relevant research question.
- Briefly describing the results including with dynamically generated tables and figures.
- Describes the data gathering and analysis in maximum 1500 words also using literate programming.

#Contents of the repository

A part from this Readme file, decribing its content, the repository contains the following elements:

- **Third_Assignment(2).Rmd**, containing our assignment in R Markdown language. It includes the research question, the description of data sources, the process of data gathering and data cleaning, and the preliminary results of descriptive and inferential statistical modelling. 

- **Third_Assignment_2_.pdf** is the PDF version of the Markdown document, formatted in academic style and including charts, plots and a references list.

- **ObservationData_rblkfmd.csv** (also in zip format), containing the time series of data on top 10% average income in Singapore from 1995 until 2014, downloaded from the orld Top Incomes Database available on [Knoema](http://knoema.com/).
    
- **ObservationData_zqpldgb.csv** (also in zip format), containing the time series of data on bottom 90% average income in Singapore from 1995 until 2014, downloaded from the orld Top Incomes Database available on [Knoema](http://knoema.com/).
    
- **Final.data.frame.csv**, the final dataframe that we created by merging all the single datasets that we are using for our analysis, composed on 20 observations and 14 variables. We exported the file as csv in our repository in order to have it at our disposal in the further steps of our work. 

- **Correlation plot**, showing the correlation among the different variables taken into consideration in the anlysis. We exported it in our repository for the same reason as the Final.data.frame.csv.
    
- **bibliography.bib**, a text file listing the references cited in our assignment

- **packeges.bib**, a text file including the citations for all the R packages we used in our analysis.
